		<p> I was born in Paoli, Pennsylvania on April 4, 1995. I am the youngest of three, with an older brother and sister. When I was three, my family moved to Portland, Oregon, where I lived until I left for college. Throughout my childhood, I enjoyed playing soccer and piano. As I grew, sports and music became a large part of my life. I began playing baritone in elementary school, and three years later switched to tuba, which I played for six years until the end of high school. I also enjoy playing basketball, used to run track in high school, and play ultimate frisbee. In middle school, I developed an interest in politics. I pursued this through various extracurriculars, and am now close to completing a bachelors in Political Science from Tufts university. In addition to politics, I am pursuing a minor in mathematics as well as a variety of computer science courses. </p>
		
		<p> Throughout my childhood, my dad helped develop my appreciation for the outdoors. Since attending college at Tufts, I have begun to incorporate that passion into my academic and career pursuits. I have interned for the American Hiking Society and taken classes focused on environmental policy. Last summer, I began leading trips for Overland, a company that offers outdoor adventures for elementary through high school students. In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors through hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, and photography. </p>
