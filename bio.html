		<p> Although born in Pennsylvania, Ben grew up in Portland, Oregon. He attended Lincoln High School, where he competed on the Constitution Team, was a co-president of the Model United Nations club, ran track & field his senior year, and was a leader in the school concert & marching band. He went on to enroll in Tufts University, and recently graduated with a B.A. in Political Science and a mathematics minor. </p>
		
		<p> Throughout my childhood, my dad helped develop my appreciation for the outdoors. Since attending college at Tufts, I have begun to incorporate that passion into my academic and career pursuits. I have interned for the American Hiking Society and taken classes focused on environmental policy. Last summer, I began leading trips for Overland, a company that offers outdoor adventures for elementary through high school students. In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors through hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, and photography. </p>
