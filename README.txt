In this assignment, I created a portfolio website. I included a homepage with a photo, as well as a menu wtih links to my bio and resume. Each of these pages also includes the same menu to increase accesibility. There are 3 html files, one for eache webpage, and a styling css file that applies to all 3 pages. These are all included in this github repository. The url http://www.cs.tufts.ed/~bskach01/ redirects to the github portfolio.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this project, but I used websites such as w3schools and stack overflow extensively to learn tags, improve styling, understand the code, and troubleshoot. I worked on this project for approximately 6 hours.
