				<h2 class="center-h2"> Independent Study Project </h2>
				<div class="isp-description">
					<p> During the spring 2016 semester, I studied abroad in Nepal. As an end of semester project, I was given a month to conduct and independent study project on a topic of my choice. I decided to spend several weeks hiking through rural Nepal to study the effects of recent road and trail development in the region. I interviewed locals, tourists, and government officials to analyze the cultural and economic effects that these developments were having. </p>
					<p> Upon finishing my trek through the Himalayas, I returned to Kathmandu to compile what I had learned. Completing the project involved extensive research into online resources from the Nepali government as well as tourism sites. I was able to incorporate my photography into the project as well to help the reader visualize what I was describing, and increase the asthetic appeal of the project. </p>
					<p> The final result of the month was a 40 page paper and a presentation on my findings to a an audience that included Nepali scholars, government officials, and foreign nationals from accross the globe. By clicking <a class="isp-text-link" href="portfolio/isp.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a> or on the cover page to the left, you can access the full text of my work. </p>
