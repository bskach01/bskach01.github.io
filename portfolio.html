				<p class="portfolio-description"> As an intern, I managed the American Hiking Society Instagram account during the summer of 2015. I developed custom posts and graphic content and shared member-contributed content as well. </p>

				<h2 class="center-h2"> Independent Study Project </h2>
				<div class="isp-description">
					<p> During the spring 2016 semester, I studied abroad in Nepal. As an end of semester project, I was given a month to conduct and independent study project on a topic of my choice. I decided to spend several weeks hiking through rural Nepal to study the effects of recent road and trail development in the region. I interviewed locals, tourists, and government officials to analyze the cultural and economic effects that these developments were having. </p>
					<p> Upon finishing my trek through the Himalayas, I returned to Kathmandu to compile what I had learned. Completing the project involved extensive research into online resources from the Nepali government as well as tourism sites. I was able to incorporate my photography into the project as well to help the reader visualize what I was describing, and increase the asthetic appeal of the project. </p>
					<p> The final result of the month was a 40 page paper and a presentation on my findings to a an audience that included Nepali scholars, government officials, and foreign nationals from accross the globe. By clicking <a class="isp-text-link" href="portfolio/isp.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a> or on the cover page to the left, you can access the full text of my work. </p>

				<h2 class="center-h2"> Outdoor Leadership </h2>

				<div class="outdoor-description">
					<p> I have extensive experience leading outdoor trips. As a summer job, I have worked as a trip leader for Overland Summers. During this time, I worked closely with a co-leader to take groups of 12 students on outdoor adventures. Being a leader meant teaching outdoor and safety skills, keeping track of budgets, encouraging inclusivity, managing group dynamics, and ensuring the safety of everyone in an inherently risky environment. </p>
					<p> I also organized and led trips near Tufts during the school year. Through Tufts Mountain Club, I led hiking trips for younger students, where I was in charge of route planning, medical preparedness, and decision-making. I also taught courses to help other students become safe and confident rock climbers. As a senior, I led a trip for Tufts Wilderness Orientation, where I brought 8 incoming first-year students on a pre-orientation trip to prepare for college. This year, I returned after graduation to lead a training trip where I could pass on my knowledge and skills to new leaders.</p>
